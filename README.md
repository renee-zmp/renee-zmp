- Hey there! I'm Renée, a person who's interested in everything and curious about all detais.
  I'm here starting a new journey, and constructing my bases to jump to a new career. We gotta be brave, right?
  Right now, I'm learning the basics of C and Shell. Talk about "coding for dummies" huh? hahahah
  Feel free to message me if you have anything to say. I'll be glad to make more friends =)
